THE END
This lovely little dog is named Nutty. He is very hungry so he went looking for some food. He walked into an old, dirty room with a table in it piled with seafood and equipment. He suddenly spotted a lobster. He began attacking it, so he could eat it. But poor Nutty got bitten on his paw by the lobster because it was angry he was attacking him. Nutty quickly ran out of the room, back to his usual home, in the town's local dump, and he went searching for food amongst the rubbish.
One day on the farm I went to feed the cicks chickens and the noisy thing the rooster to but he sneeked along one becouse he new something fishy was going on.
